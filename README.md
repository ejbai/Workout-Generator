# Workout Generator

This is a simple program that takes lists of exercises (in three categories: push, pull, and legs) and outputs a workout plan for the week using a certain number of randomly selected exercises from each list and alternating what is focused on each day.

There are a lot of things that could be improved but I just wanted to create something to start with.

Note: there are many apps that do this exact thing but 10x better, so this was just a for fun type of thing for me.
